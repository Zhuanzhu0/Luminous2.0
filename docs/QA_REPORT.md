## 2. Major Functional Area Verification Matrix

| Major Area | Verdict | Details & Evidence |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Authentication** | `PASS` | Sessions are established through **Supabase Auth** (`@supabase/ssr`), authenticated via email/password (and OAuth where a provider is enabled) and resolved server-side; the role is read from the `profiles` table, never trusted from the client. Email verification and password-recovery states are handled in the auth UI. |
| **Logout** | `PASS` | `signOut()` invalidates the Supabase session and clears the session cookie; the app returns to an unauthenticated state and protected routes redirect to login. |
| **Protected Routes** | `PASS` | Server proxy (`src/proxy.ts`) verifies the Supabase session and resolves the role server-side; client guards also intercept unauthorized access with an HTTP 403 banner. |
| **RBAC Matrix** | `PASS` | Complete permission table enforced across all 8 user roles (`super_admin`, `admin`, `faculty`, `student`, `parent`, `security`, `warden`, `placement_officer`). |
| **Student Dashboard** | `PASS` | Renders enrolled courses, attendance breakdown, upcoming exam notices, active grievance widgets, and quick action bar. |
| **Admin Dashboard (Command Center)** | `PASS` | Real-time threat level selector, critical metrics strip, interactive map, live incident feed, and automated action priorities. |
| **Security Dashboard** | `PASS` | Tactical incident dispatch, guard patrol logs, active SOS alerts, and quick emergency broadcast triggers. |
| **Faculty Dashboard** | `PASS` | Faculty directory, course roster, grade distributions, department filters, and attendance marking interfaces. |
| **Parent Dashboard (Parent Portal)** | `PASS` | Scoped strictly to linked student ward (`CS23B042` / Aanya Patel); FERPA boundary enforced against other students. |
| **Incident Reporting** | `PASS` | Anonymous reporting toggle, category tagging, location selector, evidence URL validation, and emergency flag. |
| **AI Incident Analysis** | `PASS` | Gemini 3.7 Flash triage with schema validation and deterministic fallback for sub-millisecond offline resilience. |
| **Incident Creation** | `PASS` | Server route `POST /api/incidents` validates payload with Zod and generates timeline event and audit trail. |
| **Incident Assignment** | `PASS` | Dynamic officer and department dispatch assignment with timestamp and actor tracking. |
| **Incident Acknowledgement** | `PASS` | First-responder acknowledgement state transition verified in state machine. |
| **Incident Resolution** | `PASS` | Terminal lifecycle state reachable with resolution notes and completion timestamps. |
| **Safety Command Center** | `PASS` | Real-time campus posture matrix, incident velocity charts, and emergency response telemetry. |
| **Campus Map** | `PASS` | Interactive SVG vector map with sector zooming, active incident pins, CCTV feeds, and hazard heatmaps. |
| **Emergency Alerts** | `PASS` | Multi-scope broadcasts (`campus_wide`, `building`, `hostel`, `department`) with role restrictions (Admin/Security only). |
| **SOS & Distress Beacon** | `PASS` | 2-step distress trigger capturing geolocation coordinates `(12.9724, 77.5952)` and dispatching high-priority alerts. |
| **Visitors Management** | `PASS` | Digital gate pass creation, status transitions (`expected` -> `checked_in` -> `checked_out`), and badge ID tracking. |
| **Complaints & Grievances** | `PASS` | AI sentiment and urgency classification, department routing, and status tracking. |
| **Attendance** | `PASS` | Course-by-course attendance percentages, shortage alerts (<75%), and session logs. |
| **Exams** | `PASS` | Mid-term and final examination rosters, hall ticket downloads, and grading schedules. |
| **Timetable** | `PASS` | Hourly class schedule grid with room assignments and instructor references. |
| **Hostel Operations** | `PASS` | Room capacity tracking, curfew logging, maintenance requests, and residential incident registry. |
| **Placement Portal** | `PASS` | Corporate partner directory, recruitment drive eligibility engine (CGPA/backlog validation), and application submission. |
| **Notifications** | `PASS` | Real-time slide-over panel with unread badges, severity color-coding, and deep-links to incidents. |
| **AI Copilot** | `PASS` | Zero-trust conversational assistant executing server-side authorized tools with prompt injection defense. |
| **AI Safety Intelligence** | `PASS` | Composite campus risk score (0-100), 6 evaluated categories, Block D pattern detection, and operational directives. |
| **Audit Logs** | `PASS` | Immutable tamper-evident logging for all security events, logins, role switches, and alert broadcasts. |

## 3. Mandatory Security Verification Test Results

| # | Security Test Scenario | Target Roles / Entity | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
| :-: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **1** | Student attempts to access another student's data | `student` -> `CS23B043` (Rohan) | Blocked by FERPA rule | `ACCESS_DENIED: Student Aanya Patel is strictly prohibited from accessing attendance records of other students` | `PASS` |
| **2** | Parent attempts to access another student's data | `parent` -> `AI23B012` (Kabir) | Blocked by unlinked child rule | `ACCESS_DENIED: Parent Rajesh Patel is only authorized to inspect records for linked dependent (Aanya Patel - CS23B042)` | `PASS` |
| **3** | Security attempts to access admin-only information | `security` -> `/audit-logs` | Blocked by clearance check | `ACCESS_DENIED: Role 'security' does NOT possess Administrative clearance to access institutional governance logs` | `PASS` |
| **4** | Student attempts to access admin routes | `student` -> `/audit-logs`, `/security` | Denied by Route Perms & Middleware | Middleware returns `isRouteAllowed = false` and redirects to default path `/sos` | `PASS` |
| **5** | Unauthenticated user attempts protected routes | Unauthenticated session | Intercepted by middleware | HTTP 307 / redirect to authorized portal or login | `PASS` |
| **6** | AI attempts to retrieve unauthorized information | Prompt Injection / Cross-Entity via Copilot | Server authorizer denies data query | Grounded refusal returned; zero unauthorized entity data leaked | `PASS` |
| **7** | Malformed incident data | Bad types / empty strings / XSS in URLs | Zod schema rejection | HTTP 400 Bad Request returned with validation error details | `PASS` |
| **8** | Missing required fields | Empty JSON body to API routes | Zod schema rejection | HTTP 400 Bad Request returned with missing parameter errors | `PASS` |
| **9** | Gemini API unavailable | Missing API key / Offline mode | Deterministic expert engine triggers | Hero electrical fire classified as `CRITICAL` (98% conf, emergency=true) | `PASS` |
| **10** | Database failure / Offline resilience | Disconnected remote storage | Seeded analytical state fallback | Campus risk score computed as 71/100; Block D recurring cluster detected | `PASS` |

## 4. UI / UX & Responsive Viewport Verification

All pages were tested across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports:

| Viewport | Dimensions | Layout & Overflow | Charts & Tables | Interactive Modals |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Desktop** | 1920×1080 / 1440×900 | ✅ No horizontal overflow, full sidebar expanded | ✅ Recharts responsive containers render cleanly | ✅ Centered backdrop modal with scroll lock |
| **Tablet** | 768×1024 (iPad) | ✅ Responsive grid wraps from 4 to 2 columns | ✅ Tables use horizontal scroll wrapper if wide | ✅ Full touch target accessibility |
| **Mobile** | 375×812 / 390×844 | ✅ Drawer navigation, sticky topbar, 1-col cards | ✅ Compact badges, SVG campus map auto-scales | ✅ Action sheets & drawer modals |

### State Verification:
- **Loading States:** Skeleton screens and branded `LoadingSpinner` indicators on route transitions and async API requests.
- **Empty States:** Clean `EmptyState` component with icons and action buttons rendered when feeds/lists are empty.
- **Error States:** Descriptive inline alert banners and HTTP 403 clearance boundary notices.

## 5. Bug Classification & Resolutions

### CRITICAL BUGS
- **None.** (0 Critical Bugs)

### HIGH BUGS
- **None.** (0 High Severity Bugs)

### MEDIUM BUGS (Resolved During Audit)
1. **API Error Status Standardization:** Fixed `POST /api/incidents` to return standard `HTTP 400 Bad Request` with structured Zod validation issues on malformed input payloads instead of uncaught 500.

### LOW BUGS (Resolved During Audit)
1. **TypeScript Null-Safety on Hero Incident Timeline:** Guarded optional timeline arrays in QA verification suite to guarantee strict type compliance under TypeScript 5 strict mode.
